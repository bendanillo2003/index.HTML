  <h1>YOU [BASIL VALDEZ]</h1>
  <p>
    [Verse 1]
    You give me hope, the strength, the will to keep on
    No one else can make me feel this way
    And only you can bring out all the best I can do
    I believe you turn the tide
    And make me feel real good inside
    </p>

    [Verse 2]
    You pushed me up when I'm about to give up
    You're on my side when no one seems to listen
    And if you go, you know the tears can't help but show
    You'll break this heart and tear it apart
    Then suddenly, the madness starts    
    </p>

    [Chorus]
    It's your smile, your face, your lips that I miss
    Those sweet little eyes that stare at me
    And make me say, "I'm with you through all the way"
    'Cause it's you who fills the emptiness in me
    It changes everything you see
    When I know I've got you with me
    </p>

    [Verse 3]
    You pushed me up when I'm about to give up
    You're on my side when no one seems to listen
    And if you go, you know the tears can't help but show
    You'll break this heart and tear it apart
    Then suddenly, the madness starts
    </p>
    
    [Chorus]
    It's your smile, your face, your lips that I miss
    Those sweet little eyes that stare at me
    And make me say, "I'm with you through all the way"
    'Cause it's you who fills the emptiness in me
    It changes everything you see
    When I know I've got you with me
    </p>

    [Chorus]
    It's your smile, your face, your lips that I miss
    Those sweet little eyes that stare at me
    And make me say, "I'm with you through all the way"
    'Cause it's you who fills the emptiness in me
    It changes everything you see
    When I know I've got you with me
    </p>
